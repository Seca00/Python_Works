Python things I made



Analyzer Server and StaticAnalyzer are part of the distributed system I've built for static analyzing android apks.
It sends and gets message between and more than one worker can be assigned to one distributer.
I've moved it to docker later which made it easy to open multiple workers on one computer.

Processes is a part of the messaging system and the processes can be applied one by one.

Elastic Consumer is a consumer that reads messages from elastic search.
